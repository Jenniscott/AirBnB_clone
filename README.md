# AirBnB Clone

## Description of the Project

This repository contains a simplified clone of the AirBnB web application. It is a comprehensive project designed to emulate the core functionalities of AirBnB, including property listings, user interactions, and booking features. The project is structured to follow a console-oriented approach for managing different aspects of the application, providing a foundation for understanding backend development and database interactions.

## Description of the Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial part of this project, enabling users to interact with the application's data models through a command-line interface (CLI). It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects within the application.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jenniscott/AirBnB_clone.git
   cd AirBnB_clone
   ```

2. **Make the console executable**:
   ```sh
   chmod +x console.py
   ```

3. **Run the console**:
   ```sh
   ./console.py
   ```

### How to Use the Command Interpreter

The command interpreter supports several commands to manage the application's data. Below is a list of available commands and their descriptions:

- `help`: Displays a list of available commands or detailed help for a specific command.
- `quit`: Exits the command interpreter.
- `EOF`: Exits the command interpreter.
- `create <class>`: Creates a new instance of the specified class.
- `show <class> <id>`: Displays the string representation of an instance based on the class and id.
- `destroy <class> <id>`: Deletes an instance based on the class and id.
- `all [<class>]`: Displays all instances of the specified class or all instances if no class is specified.
- `update <class> <id> <attribute name> <attribute value>`: Updates an instance based on the class and id by adding or updating an attribute.

### Examples

Here are some examples to demonstrate how to use the command interpreter:

1. **Creating a new instance**:
   ```sh
   (hbnb) create User
   1f3e9d1e-0df5-4c52-9f65-07bcdc6d736f
   ```

2. **Showing an instance**:
   ```sh
   (hbnb) show User 1f3e9d1e-0df5-4c52-9f65-07bcdc6d736f
   [User] (1f3e9d1e-0df5-4c52-9f65-07bcdc6d736f) {'id': '1f3e9d1e-0df5-4c52-9f65-07bcdc6d736f', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 21, 15, 42, 1, 123456), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 21, 15, 42, 1, 123456)}
   ```

3. **Updating an instance**:
   ```sh
   (hbnb) update User 1f3e9d1e-0df5-4c52-9f65-07bcdc6d736f name "John Doe"
   ```

4. **Showing all instances**:
   ```sh
   (hbnb) all User
   [[User] (1f3e9d1e-0df5-4c52-9f65-07bcdc6d736f) {'id': '1f3e9d1e-0df5-4c52-9f65-07bcdc6d736f', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 21, 15, 42, 1, 123456), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 21, 15, 42, 1, 123456), 'name': 'John Doe'}]
   ```

5. **Destroying an instance**:
   ```sh
   (hbnb) destroy User 1f3e9d1e-0df5-4c52-9f65-07bcdc6d736f
   ```

These commands provide a robust interface for interacting with the applicationâ€™s backend, allowing for effective testing and development of the AirBnB clone project.
